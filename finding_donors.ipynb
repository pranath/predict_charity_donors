    "CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley in the USA that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML needs help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, my goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "My main objective with this project is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features are likely to fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. "

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most 50K, and those that make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for the data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Supervised Learning model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem - I have judged the following features are appropriate & desirable in guiding the selection of a machine learning model, assuming the problem is to predict people who earn over 50k as a one-off prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory & speed**: not primarily important but for what is feasible to be run within a notebook in a reasonable time, the aim is assumed to be a one off run of the model to predict rather than a model run continously where significant computational resources might be more an issue.\n",
    "- **Not overfitting**: I would regard this as desirable/important, we want a model that generalises well, its only going to be run once and we want to maximise the predictive power on this one run to ensure the charities resources are least wasted in identifying only the most likely donors.\n",
    "- **Time for learning/fitting**: like memory & speed, not so important beyond that which is reasonable to be run in the notebook without the browser timing out!\n",
    "- **Time for predicting**: again like time for learning/fitting, not so important beyond what can be done in the notebook/browser.\n",
    "- **Parameterisation**: slightly important. We will be using grid search later to optimise our solution, this will multiply the computational requirements used for a single model. Given the limit of our computatioal resources available in the notebook/browser a more simple parameterisation would allow the model to scale & deliver within this limited environment for a grid search.\n",
    "- **Feature tolerance**: important, this dataset now has over 100 features, we would like a model that scales well in performance in relation to a large number of features.\n",
    "- **Correlation tolerance**: important, this dataset now has over 100 features many of which may be correlated with each other. We would like a model that is more tolerant to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these in mind, these are my selected models, their features - and the rationale for choosing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 1 - LogisticRegression**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths of model**: Fast to train, no parameter tuning, features don't need scaling, more tolerant to correlated features, excellent for 2-class classification problems\n",
    "- **Weaknesses of model**: Not so good for large number of features, not good with non-linear decision boundries, not flexible enough to capture more complex relationships, adversely effected by features not relevent to output variable\n",
    "- **Why model is a good candidate for this problem**: 1. The problem is a binary classification one, logistic regression is one of the best & simplest models for this kind of problem - worth considering occams razor! 2. The computational resources required for this model are low and ensure I can be certain this model will have no problem running in the notebook/browser on this dataset! I would like at least one of my models to be likely to run well with given computational resources. 3. Likely to be many correlated features in this 100+ feature dataset, this model should be more tolerant to these in generating predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 2 - AdaBoostClassifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths of model**: Higher accuracy, handles lots of irrelavent features (does feature selection), handles correlated features, features don't need scaling, simple paramaterisation, not prone to overfitting/generalises well \n",
    "- **Weaknesses of model**: Can require large memory, slow training speed, sensitive to outliers & noisy data, not best in class (of boosting models) for many problems\n",
    "- **Why model is a good candidate for this problem**: 1. One of the first successful boosting algorithms for binary classification with higher accuracy, which is desirable for our problem 2. Should be able to handle our 100+ features (potentially correlated) well 3. Simple paramaterisation should make optimisation phase with grid search more viable 4. Our cleaned & normalised data (outliers minimised & extreme values transformed) should minimise the weaknesses of this model in this respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 3 - GradientBoostingClassifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths of model**: Can handle big datasets, very accurate, can approximate most non-linear classification boundries, one of best boosting models for many classification problems (best in class), similar pros to adaboost (no need to transform features)\n",
    "- **Weaknesses of model**: Slow to train (concern over available resources in notebook/browser sufficient?), prone to overfitting, not easy to understand, similar weaknesses to adaboost i.e. sensitive to outliers & noisy data, parameterisation can make a real difference to performance - therefore could be more work/fiddly to optimise & get best results.\n",
    "- **Why model is a good candidate for this problem**: 1. This model is one of the most popular (getting some of the best results) models for classification problems - worth serious consideration! 2. Should be able to handle our 100+ features (potentially correlated) well 3. Paramaterisation can make a real difference to performance with this model, good chance of improvement in optimisation/grid search phase for one of the best solutions (assuming computational resources of notebook/browser sufficient).\n",

    "### Which is the Best Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the evaluation of the 3 candidate models, I would reccomend use of the GradientBoostingClassifier (GBC) as the best model for identifying individuals who make more than \\$50,000 for a number of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the GBC achieves the highest F-Score on 100% the testing set (approx 0.74) of all the models. Second, the GBC also gets the highest F-Score when 100% of the training set is used (of a similar value). In fact the margin of difference between the models for the training and test sets is bigger, i.e. for the test set the GBC is even better than the next best model (Ada boost) than with the training data - suggesting the GBC model generalises the best for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, while the GBC training & prediction time is high - given for our case we assume we will only run the model once or very occasionally, it is only a small inconveience to wait a little longer for the one use of this algorithm, and a small price to pay considering the improved peformance of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, the GBC has a good record of performing well for a range of classification problems. Particular features of this model are that it can handle a large number of parameters, large data sets, and yet achieve high accuracy. While currently it is envisaged that this model be run only once - should the charity wish to run the same prediction in future with either larger datasets or datasets with even more features - this same model should perform well in these cases also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we can also see that the accuracy score for both the training & test sets is highest for GBC, another measure (tho not as important as the F-Score) of generally how well the model performs compared to the other models."

    "### Describing the Model in Layman's Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The GradientBoostingClassifier is regarded as an 'ensemble' learner - what this means is it consists of multiple  'weak leaners' working together to combine to become something can be very good at predicting i.e. a 'strong learner'.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a weak learner? what makes a good one for these boosting models? and how exactly are they combined? \n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about the problem at hand, how to predict if someone earns over 50,000 dollars - based on many input features (such as age, education, etc) this actually consists of multiple sub-problems e.g. is age a good predictor of income, and if so in what way? a weak learner aims to simply become better that random guessing at one of these sub-problems. Of course, you could make a weak learner that simply said whatever someones age, say they earn less than $50K - but this is not really any better than guessing so we would not consider or use this as a weak learner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best weak learners are actually ones that do a very good job of predicting a particular sub-problem very well, however narrow. The training process is then a matter of finding one weak learner that solves one part of the problem very well, then finding another weak learner that solves a different part of the problem very well, and so on, until the entire problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we found a weak learner that was good at predicting if individuals between the ages of 50-53 were likely to earn over \\$50,000 or not - this would be quite useful. We could then look for other weak learners which might be good at solving the remaining sub-problems (e.g. a weak learner that was say good at predicting for ages 45-49, or for specific educational levels) until you get a good overall result from the combination of all these weak learners. So in a way, a good weak learner is a specialist or expert - something very good at doing a specific job very well. It is the combination of these many weak learner/specialists/experts, each focussing and doing a good job on a different part of the overall problem - that gives this model its real power that can result in an overall model that is a good learner/expert/predictor for the entire problem - like a team of experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many types of machine learning algorithm can be used as the basis for weak learners, but the most common is what is called a 'decision tree' and this will be used in our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is used, i.e. is presented with new data, each of the weak learners it contains gets to vote on the data supplied (with their respective voting weights from the training phase applied) and in essence a kind of democracy results with the most votes deciding which category the new data falls into - i.e. when the model predicts we input all the features (age, education etc), the weak learners all look at this data and vote for if they they that person earns over or under \\$50,000 - and the result with the most (& biggest votes) is the prediction made by the model overall.\n"

    "It is interesting to compare my intuitions to the models most relevant features for predicting salary.

Also on education, while I picked education, the model found education-num as the best predictor feature of all.\n",

Perhaps expressed as a more linear relationship (continous variable) education makes a better predicator, than many one-hot-encoded categorical variables for education which are treated as separate/unrelated?\n",

    "The Married-civ-spouse is also surprising - I honestly would have thought for example if anything, a single person for example would be a better predictor!

    "\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. Below we will use the same optimized model we found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Our particular model chosen (Gradient Boosting) could be deployed several times, and could even be applied to significantly bigger datasets and still should scale in terms of performance relatively well."
